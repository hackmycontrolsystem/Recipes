2 lbs lean ground beef
1 cup bread crumbs cut in cubes (I prefer a light wheat as darker breads tend to overpower this dish).
1 large egg
1 tsp onion powder
1/2 tsp garlic powder
1/2 tsp ground mustard
1 tsp oregeno
1 tsp basil
1/4 cup parmesan
1/2 can mushroom soup
1/2 can tomato paste
2 Tbsp ketchup
1 dash salt
1 dash pepper
1 dash chilli powder (optional)
1 dash worchestshire sauce
1/2 cup diced onions
2 cloves minced garlic

1. Heat pan and then, add olive oil, onions, and garlic
2. Fry onions and garlic together with a dash of chilli pepper (optional)
3. Allow to cool by removing from pan
4. Pre-heat oven to 375-degrees Fahr
5. Mix above ingredients in a large mixing bowl 
6. Grease a 9x5" pan and pour in mixed ingredients
7. Stir remaining mushroom soup and tomato paste in a small bowl. Spread ontop of flatten meatloaf mix. Adding a few dashes of dried parsley and pepper on its top adds some color to this dish.
8. Bake at 375-degrees Fahr for 45 minutes, then increase temperature to 400-degrees Fahr for 15 minutes.
