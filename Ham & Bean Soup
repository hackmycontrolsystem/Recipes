6 cups water
2 cups chicken stock
1 tsp cumin
2 bay leaves
1 Tbsp olive oil
1 cup diced onion
2 cloves garlic, minced
2 tsp oregano
1/2 tsp thyme
Ham chunks
Ham bone (preferable). Avoid Fricks as it is too salty.
20oz bag of white Nothern beans
Ketchup (to taste)

Optional: 
 - 1/2 tsp of bourbon-smoked paprika and dash of bourbon-smoked pepper
 - Grill onions in bacon.

1. Soak white beans overnight. Ensure beans are covered with enough water as they will absorb it. Drain and rinse beans.
2. Add water, stock, cumin, bay leaves, ham chunks and ham bone to a large pot.
2. Bring the seasoned ham mixture to a boil for 15 minutes in order to extract the ham flavor.
3. Add olive oil, onion, garlic, oregano, thyme and beans to the pot. Place at a rolling boil for one hour. Alternatively, throw it all in a crock pot for at least six hours.
4. Transfer soup to a slow cooker and heat at a low setting for 4+ hours.
5. Add ketchup to taste.

Best served poured ontop of Famous Dave's Cornbread muffins.
