1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F.
2. Season the raw brisket on both sides with a rub. Place in a roasting pan DRY and roast, uncovered, for 1 hour.
3. Add beef broth and enough water to yield about 1/2 inch of liquid in the roasting pan. Add a few dashes of Worcheshire and Soy sauces.
4. Lower oven to 300 degrees F, cover pan tightly and continue cooking for 2.5 hours, or until fork-tender.
5. Trim the fat and slice meat thinly across the grain. Top with juice from the pan.

Notes: 
- Modified cooking duration. 
- Modified stock to broth and tested recipe. I prefer the richness the broth adds over a stock.
- Ensure rub has a high cooking content. You can reduce rub's salt content if using Beef broth or stock.
